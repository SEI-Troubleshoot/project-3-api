## Planning Story
After our planning period we split up the setup of the front end client and back end api into pairs.  When the templates were ready, we set up the models and READMEs, then tested each CRUD with curl scripts for both resources (user and chats). Sockets.io was added for real time communication.

### User Stories

- No user stories for api

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- Javascript
- Mongodb
- Express

### Unsolved Problems

- In later version, create model for group chats
- In later version, create model for direct messaging
